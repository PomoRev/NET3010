# NET3010

Please treat this readme as a simple outline and refer to the lab instructions for details of how you should complete the lab. 

Creating an about me page that includes a professional photo (headshot is fine), your full name, contact information (use the school address but your personal email address), biography (1-3 paragraphs) describing why you decided to take the BITNet programme, a list of at least three interests with hyperlinks.

Note that if you create a custom Emmet snippet for your template (which I highly advise if you are using VSCode) then simply include just the snippet code in a file called template.html. We will discuss boiler plating in the tutorial class. 

HTML only for this exercise.
