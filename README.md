# NET3010

Please treat this readme as a simple outline and refer to the lab instructions for details of how you should complete the lab. 

Creating an about me page that includes a professional photo (headshot is fine), your full name, contact information (use the school address but your personal email address), biography (1-3 paragraphs) describing why you decided to take the BITNet programme, a list of at least three interests with hyperlinks.

Note that if you create a custom Emmet snippet for your template (which I highly advise if you are using VSCode) then simply include just the snippet code in a file called template.html. We will discuss boiler plating in the tutorial class.

We will also discuss semantic HTML in the next tutorial class which allows you to write code that works easily with CSS and JavaScript. 

HTML only for this exercise.
