<!-- ALL ABOUT SEMANTIC HTML 

definition of semantic - semiotics is the study of 
signs in literature. Those things that point to something
else as a kind of signpost in the road. Signs are much
simpler than symbols as they state plainly what they are 
pointing at where symbols remain polyvalent even when
collapsed into a meaning. A sign in this sense is like a 
traffic sign, only to be interpretted in a singular way. 
When the sign says stop, you better listen.

Anatomy of the Web Page

The semantic layout is all about organizing our webpage in such a way 
as the labels provide a signpost guide to the content. These signs allow
us to easily and logically target sections of our website for formatting
and interaction. These labes consist of id tags and class tags. Id tags 
are always singular, as in you have one #header, and class tags are often plural
as in you can have many .article blocks. Semantic layout is achieved only
when your tags tell the story of how your document is structured.
